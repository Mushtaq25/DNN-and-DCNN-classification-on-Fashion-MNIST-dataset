Deep Neural Network - A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers. There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions.

Deep Convolational Neural Network - Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN or DCNN) are the type most commonly used to identify patterns in images and video. DCNNs have evolved from traditional artificial neural networks, using a three-dimensional neural pattern inspired by the visual cortex of animals.
